# Introduction
Project Overview:
SQL analysis of job market data for Data Analysts in the Philippines  And In the demand skills , roles in the World.

What This Project Does:
This SQL project analyzes job market data to help you make smart career decisions. It answers 5 important questions about data jobs, especially for the Philippines market.

Key Insights (Simple Breakdown)
Query 1: Top-Paying Skills for Data Analysts in Philippines
What it finds: Which skills earn the most money for Data Analysts
Why it matters: Focus on learning these skills first to maximize your earning potential
Example result: If "Python" shows $80,000 average salary, it's a valuable skill to learn

Query 2: Highest-Paying Jobs in Philippines
What it finds: Job titles that pay above average
Why it matters: Know which career paths offer better compensation
Think of it like: Shopping for the best value - this shows you the "premium" jobs

Query 3: Skills Needed for Top-Paying Jobs
What it finds: What you need to know to get those high-paying jobs
Why it matters: Creates your learning roadmap
Example: If top jobs require SQL, Python, and Tableau - that's your study list!

Query 4: Rare But Valuable Skills
What it finds: Skills that aren't common but pay well (low supply, high reward)
Why it matters: Less competition + high pay = opportunity!
Think of it like: Finding a hidden gem that others overlook

Query 5: Most Optimal Skills (The Sweet Spot!)
What it finds: Skills that are BOTH in-demand AND high-paying
Why it matters: Best return on your learning time
Example: If "SQL" appears with 500+ jobs and $100k+ salary - learn it!

My thoughts
This project taught me a lot about SQL and data analysis. At first, I struggled with JOINs and subqueries, but after practicing, it got easier.
I learned that:

Data can tell interesting stories if you ask the right questions
SQL is powerful for finding patterns in data
The job market changes fast - need to keep learning

What I would do differently:

Add more filters (like remote vs onsite jobs)
Look at job trends over time
Compare different countries

Next steps:

Build a Power BI dashboard to visualize these insights
Learn Pandas to do more advanced analysis
Practice more complex SQL queries

Final Words
This project helped me understand what skills I need to focus on for my career. It's not just about learning everything - it's about learning the RIGHT things that companies actually need.
If you're also starting in data analytics like me, I hope this project helps you too! The data shows that EXCEL + SQL + Python + visualization tools are the foundation. Start there, then add cloud and machine learning later.
Remember: Everyone starts as a beginner. The important thing is to keep practicing and building projects like this!
